- **Source:** Seaborn built-in dataset
- **Size:** 150 samples, 4 features, 3 species
- **Features:** sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
- **Target:** species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

### Key Findings

#### Data Quality
- ✅ **No missing values** - Clean dataset with complete records
- ✅ **Balanced classes** - 50 samples per species (perfectly balanced)

- **Virginica:** Largest petals and sepals overall

#### Feature Relationships
- **Strong correlation** between petal length and width (r ≈ 0.96)
- **Moderate correlation** between sepal length and petal dimensions
- **Petal features** are better discriminators than sepal features

### Visualizations Created
1. **Pairplot** - Comprehensive view of all feature relationships
2. **Scatter plots** - Individual feature pair relationships

### Features Analysis

#### Key Medical Indicators
1. **age** - Age of the patient
2. **sex** - Gender (0=Female, 1=Male)
3. **cp** - Chest Pain Type (4 categories)
4. **trestbps** - Resting Blood Pressure
5. **chol** - Cholesterol Level
6. **fbs** - Fasting Blood Sugar
7. **restecg** - Resting ECG Results
8. **thalach** - Maximum Heart Rate
9. **exang** - Exercise Induced Angina
10. **oldpeak** - ST Depression
11. **slope** - Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
12. **ca** - Number of Major Vessels
13. **thal** - Thalassemia

### Model Performance

#### Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy:** [Actual values from execution]
- **AUC Score:** [Actual values from execution]
- **Precision/Recall:** [From classification report]

#### Decision Tree
- **Accuracy:** [Actual values from execution]
- **AUC Score:** [Actual values from execution]
- **Max Depth:** 5 (to prevent overfitting)

### Feature Importance Analysis

#### Top Predictive Features
Based on model analysis:
1. **Chest Pain Type (cp)** - Most significant predictor
2. **Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)** - Exercise tolerance indicator
3. **ST Depression (oldpeak)** - ECG abnormality measure
4. **Age** - Natural risk factor
5. **Gender (sex)** - Demographic risk factor

### Medical Insights

#### Risk Factors Identified
- **Chest pain type** is the strongest predictor of heart disease
- **Exercise capacity** (max heart rate) significantly impacts risk
- **Age and gender** show expected correlations with heart disease
- **Blood pressure and cholesterol** are important but not the strongest predictors

#### Clinical Relevance
- Model could assist in **screening high-risk patients**
- **Feature importance** aligns with medical literature
- **Non-invasive features** make the model practical for screening
