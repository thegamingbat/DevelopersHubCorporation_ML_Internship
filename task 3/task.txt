Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction
Objective: Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data.
Dataset: Heart Disease UCI Dataset (available on Kaggle)
Instructions:
● Clean the dataset (handle missing values if any).
● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends.
● Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree).
● Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
● Highlight important features affecting prediction.
Skills:
● Binary classification
● Medical data understanding and interpretation
● Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
● Feature importance analysis
